# FireNet

### FireNet estimates the occurance of wild fire given a county in the United States.
In the future, we might consider sending notifications to users, and develop into a mobile app. The program could be potentially used by sites such as airbnb to warn their customers of a potential evacuation.


## How to use

1. Open public/index.html
2. In a terminal rooted in the project, run `npm run dev`
3. In a live server, execute localhost:8383.

## We are considering deploying the website!

#### Currently, only certain states are supported. Check back later for progress!
